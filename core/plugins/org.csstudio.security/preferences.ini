# Security Settings

##
## Authentication
##

# Option 1:
# Use a JAAS config file as in normal use of JAAS

# Path to JAAS configuration file
# When located inside a plugin, use
#  "platform:/plugin/name.of.plugin/path/within/plugin.conf"
jaas_config_file=platform:/plugin/org.csstudio.security/jaas.conf

# Name of a JAAS login configuration to use.
# This must match the name of one of the entries
# in the jaas_config_file.
jaas_config_name=dummy

# Option 2:
# Do not use a JAAS config file.
# Instead, provide what would the desired entry in the config file
# as an Eclipse preference.
#
# If the preference "jaas_config" is defined, it will have
# precedence. "jaas_config_file" and "jaas_config_name" will
# be ignored!

# Format:
#	ModuleClass Flag option1=value1 option2=value2 ...; ModuleClass Flag ModuleOptions; ...
# ModuleClass, Flag and value options are in the same format as in auth.conf, but all on one line.
# Value strings must be quoted.
#
# Example:
#jaas_config=com.sun.jmx.remote.security.FileLoginModule required debug="true" passwordFile="/path/to/my_passwords.conf";
jaas_config=

## Authorization
##

# Select authorization provider
#
# Standard implementations:
# FileBased, see org.csstudio.security.authorization.FileBasedAuthorizationProvider
# LDAPGroup, see org.csstudio.security.authorization.LDAPGroupAuthorizationProvider
# Script, see org.csstudio.security.authorization.ScriptAuthorizationProvider
#
# Additional providers can be added via extension point,
# see org.csstudio.security.authorization.AuthorizationProvider
authorization_provider=FileBased

# Path to FileBased authorization configuration file
authorization_file_name=platform:/plugin/org.csstudio.security/authorization.conf

# Path to command used by Script authorization
authorization_script_name=/usr/local/bin/id_auth

# URL of LDAP and start of search for group-based authorization
ldap_group_url=ldap://localhost/dc=test,dc=ics
ldap_group_base=ou=Group

# Will be combined with the path in the URL and the name.
#
# Example:
# ldap_group_url=ldap://localhost/dc=test,dc=ics
# ldap_group_base=ou=Group
#
# Authorization for which to determine members: archive_config
# => Locate "cn=archive_config,ou=Groups,dc=example,dc=com"
#    and every "memberUid" will then provide a user name
#    who has the archive_config autorization.

## Secure Preferences
##

# Where secure preferences are located.
#
# "Default":
# Use the default location, which is typically
# the user's home directory.
#  @see SecurePreferencesFactory#getDefault()
#  
# Advantage: It's the default
# Disadvantage: You won't always know where the preferences are.
#
# "Instance":
# Use the Eclipse 'instance', i.e. the workspace.
# 
# Advantage: You know where it is, and each workspace
# will have its own settings.
# Disadvantage: Each workspace has different settings.
#
# "Install":
# Use the Eclipse 'install' location, i.e. where the product is installed.
# 
# Advantage: You know where it is, and every workspace for that
# product will have the same settings. Good for a "global" setup.
# Disadvantage: Ordinary users cannot (should not) have write permissions.
secure_preference_location=Default
