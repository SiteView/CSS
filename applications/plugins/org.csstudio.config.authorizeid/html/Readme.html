<h1>AuthorizeId</h1>
<p>
Authorize Id is a plugin for CSS, which works with LDAP entries that are in group EpicsAuthorizeID. 
It can display entries, create new, edit and delete them. Entries in first table are names, entries 
in second table are attributes of that name. If name is edited or deleted,  all attributes are 
automatically edited or deleted too.
<br/>
</p>
<h3>If entry name is not valid?</h3>
<p>
Plugin will automatically forbid user to enter a name which is invalid, for example if name is empty
or has LDAP non-supported characters.
</p>
<br/>

<h3>Tips and tricks</h3>
<p>
To find a field name or attributes quickly, just type it and it will automatically go to a row with 
that field name. You can also click on column header to sort the names or attributes alphabetically. 
<br/><br/>
All text, that is shown on screen, can be changed easily in a file "messages.properties".
<br/><br/>
Timeout for accessing data from LDAP can be changed in classes: LdapEain, LdapGroups and LdapProp, if it
appears they are too small or too big.
<br/>

<h4>BUGS:</h4>
<p>
---
<br/>
<font size="2">
There is a bug, that happens only under special circumstances. For example, if CSS is not opened for some 
time (computer is off), when starting CSS and AuthorizeId for the first time, it may happen that groups
are empty.
<br/><br/>
The reason for this bug is not clear, but I think it has something to do with connecting to LDAP and 
getting data from it and maybe connecting to LDAP has a bit of delay and it cannot get data so fast for 
the first time.

Closing and reopening plugin will solve the problem (no CSS restart is needed).

Note this bug is fixed, but to be sure I still left this bug described here, if there will
be any problems.
