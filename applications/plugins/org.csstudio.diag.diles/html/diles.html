<h1>Overview</h1>
Diles stands for <b>Di</b>gital <b>L</b>ogic <b>E</b>ditor & <b>S</b>imulator. 
Diles allows users to create visual logic diagrams using different logic operators such as AND, OR, XOR.

<br /><br />

Diles is based on <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/gef/">Eclipse Graphical Editing Framework (GEF)</a>.

<h2>Usage</h2>
Diles allows user to create logic diagrams using digital widgets. Those widgets can be connected. Widgets 
with inputs will read output of upper widget. If upper widget is after the lower widget in the time line, 
the default value (false) will be taken as input. In the next cycle, after upper widget has been executed, 
the value from a cycle before will be taken as input.

<br /><br />

<h3><font color="#050072">Flip Flop</font></h3>
The truth table for Flip Flop: <br /><br />
<table>
<tr>
<td><b>J</b></td><td><b>K</b></td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Q</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>0</td><td>0</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>0</td><td>1</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td><td>0</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td><td>1</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOT Q (opposite)</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h3><font color="#050072">TDE & TDD Timers</font></h3>
TDE Timer waits for a certain amount of seconds if the input is <b>0</b>. It always outputs <b>1</b>.<br /><br />
TDD Timer waits for a certain amount of seconds if the input is <b>1</b>. It always outputs <b>0</b>.

<h3><font color="#050072">Inputs and Outputs</font></h3>
There are two kinds of inputs (Hardware Input and Command) and two kinds of outputs (Hardware Output and Status).<br /><br />
Both inputs act the same way in Diles. Same goes for outputs. The reason there are two implemented is 
for the user to be able to know which input (or output) is which.

<h3><font color="#050072">Analog Input and Comparator</font></h3>
Analog Input has a value of some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number">Real number</a>. 
Comparator takes two Analog Input widgets for input. If + input is <b>larger or same</b> than -, Comparator will 
return <b>true</b>. If + input is <b>smaller</b> than -, Comparator will return <b>false</b>.

<h3><font color="#050072">Connection</font></h3>
Connection connects widgets together. It can start only in output and end in input. Only one input connection is 
possible per one widget input terminal. More output connections are possible per widget output terminal.
<br /><br />
Connections can be bent. This is a visual feature of connections.

<h2>For developers</h2>
<h3><font color="#050072">Known bugs</font></h3>
<ul>
  <li>pressing Save button or pressing CTRL+S doesn't seem to work for some unknown reason; project can be saved only when editor is closed</li>
  <li>Editor doesn't show file name in it's name (that could also be a feature)</li>
</ul>

<h3><font color="#050072">Possible plan for the future</font></h3>
<ul>
  <li>enable dynamic number of input connections for widgets (currently it is limited to 1 or 2)</li>
  <li>finish TableView.java class which represents a table of inputs and outputs</li>
</ul>

<h3><font color="#050072">Possible integration with IOC</font></h3>
As far as I know, IOC can take some code as parameter. To be possible to develop this application further 
so it would be completely integrated with IOC, a program has to be written that would transform XML code (which 
is located in <filename>.diles) into IOC code. The program should use some external XML helper (as JDOM) to 
get the right data.<br /><br />

The relevant data for IOC would be: 
<br /><br />-- Activity type, unique_id, column, name, status -- <i>(last two are only relevant for inputs and outputs)</i>
<br /><br />-- connection source_id, source_terminal, target_id, target_terminal -- <i>(the last one could be ignored, as there is only one output terminal per widget possible</i>
<br /><br />The program's job would also be to create temporary variables, as they are not used in Diles.
