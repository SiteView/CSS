/**
 * This is a stateful service helping views by the management of connections and message lists. This
 * is a SINGLETON because it maintains the state for several views even beyond their lifetime. The
 * log view and its subclasses use this service to map a topic set to lists of messages and
 * connections. Usage:<br>
 * If a new topic set is selected by the user (find out if its new using hasTopicSet), an
 * appropriate message list is created and a connection to the underlying message system is built
 * (createAndConnectForTopicSet).<br>
 * If the user switches to another topic set, the former connection is maintained, allowing for
 * switching back quickly (retrieving the current message list using getMessageListForTopicSet).
