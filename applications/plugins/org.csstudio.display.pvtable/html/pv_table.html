<title>PV Table</title>

<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
The PV Table provides a tabular view of PV names and their current value with time stamp and alarm state.
</p>
<p>
You can take a "snapshot" of current values, and the table will now highlight rows
where the current value differs from the snapshot.
</p>
<p>
The configuration (PV names, saved value) can be saved and later re-loaded.

<h2>Adding and Removing PVs</h2>
<p>
Enter new PV names in last row of table, or 'drop' them via drag-and-drop into table.
</p>
<p>
Delete PV names by changing their name to an empty name,
or by selecting one or more PVs and deleting them via the context menu.
</p>


<h2>Tolerance</h2>
<p>
Values are highlighted when they differ from the saved snapshot value by a certain amount.
The currently used tolerance is displayed in the tool-tip of a table row.
This 'tolerance' value can be configured via the context menu of selected table rows.
</p>


<h1>History</h1>

<h2>Version 3.2.0 - 2012-12-05</h2>
<p>
Ported to PVManager, including simpler GUI based on Kunal Schroff's pvmanager.pvtable,
but still supporting snapshot/restore:
</p>
<ul>
<li>No more need to start/stop, always updating current value.</li>
<li>No more 'add' via context menu, simply enter new name to end of table.</li>
<li>PV Names can be edited.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Original, ca. 2006</h2>
<p>
Started as a demo for something similar to XAL 'score'.
