<h1>Alarm Tree User's Guide</h1>
<p>This is the user's guide for the alarm tree.</p>
<h2>Preferences</h2>
<p>The preference page for the alarm tree is <i>CSS Applications &gt; Alarm
&gt; Alarm Tree</i>.</p>
<p>First, make sure that the LDAP directory server and the JMS servers are set
up correctly. The alarm tree will listen to two JMS servers for redundancy.
Changing the JMS settings after the tree is already running requires a
restart.</p>
<p>After the servers are set up, you can use the <i>Facility names</i> list to
add the facilities that you would like to display in the tree. You can select
any number of facilities. You can change the LDAP settings and facility
selection even when the tree is already running. Simply click the
&quot;Reload&quot; button in the tree's toolbar after saving the new
preferences. The alarm tree will use the new setting when reloading the
tree.</p>

<h2>Using the view</h2>
<h3>Icons</h3>
<p>The view displays each node with colored circles which indicate the current
alarm state and, if applicable, the most severe past alarm which has not been
acknowledged yet. The colors have the following meaning:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blue: invalid</li>
<li>Red: major</li>
<li>Yellow: minor</li>
<li>Green: no alarm</li>
</ul>
<p>The right/foreground icon always indicates the current alarm state. If the
current alarm is acknowledged, a checkmark is displayed on top of the alarm
icon. If there are past alarms for a node which have a higher severity than the
current alarm and which have not been acknowledged yet, a second icon is
displayed to the left of and behind the primary icon.</p>
<p>For the leaf nodes which represent individual records (process variables),
the icon indicates the alarm state of that record. For nodes which have child
nodes, the icon indicates the highest severity of its children.</p>
<h3>Acknowledging alarms</h3>
<p>When a node has any unacknowledged alarms, you can use the context menu of
then ode to send an acknowledgement message for that node. Note that the node
will not be displayed as acknowledged immediately. The tree will update the
node's state when it receives the acknowledgement message.</p>
<p>An acknowledgement always acknowledges both the current alarm, and any past
unacknowledged alarms. When the selected node is a parent node, one
acknowledgement message will be sent for each child that has an unacknowledged
alarm.</p>
<h3>Opening the alarm display</h3>
<p>If an alarm display is configured for a record in the LDAP directory, you
can open that alarm display from the context menu using the &quot;Run alarm
display&quot; action. Note that this menu item appears only if a single leaf
node (process variable node) is selected. It is not available for parent nodes
or multi selections. If the menu item appears grayed out, no alarm display is
configured for that process variable, or the attribute value does not look like
a valid CSS display file name (the value must end with .css-sds).</p>

<h2>Editing Support</h2>
<p>The view contains support for editing the LDAP directory which defines the
structure of the node displayed in the view.</p>
<h3>Using the context menu</h3>
<p>The context menu for a node contains menu items for deleting the node. For
nodes which are not channels, it also contains menu items for creating a new
component or subcomponent below the selected node, and for creating a new
channel within the selected node. Whether a component or a subcomponent is
created is determined automatically: if the selected node is a facility, you
can create component nodes, if it is a component or a subcomponent, you can
create subcomponents.</p>
<p>Note that deletion does not work recursively, i.e., you can only delete nodes
that do not have any subnodes. This is because of restrictions of the underlying
LDAP server and also to prevent accidental deletion of large trees.</p>
<h3>Using drag&amp;drop</h3>
<p>In addition to using the context menu, you can also use the drag&amp;drop
features of the Control System Studio to add additional channels to the tree.
Simply select one or more channels in any view that supports drag&amp;drop and
drag them into the alarm tree. While you are dragging items over the tree, the
mouse cursor will change to indicate where you can drop those items.</p>
<p>Note that the tree currently only supports dragging items into the tree. You
cannot drag channel names or other nodes out of the tree into other views.
Support for dragging will probably be added in a later version.</p>
<h3>Editing the properties of nodes</h3>
<p>You can use the Eclipse Property View to edit the properties of the nodes
in the tree. The properties are stored as attributes in the LDAP directory. The
property view can be opened by clicking the &quot;Property View&quot; button in
the view's toolbar.</p>
<p>The available properties are:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Alarm display</dt>
<dd>The filename of the alarm display associated with the node. If this
property contains the name of a CSS-SDS display file, you can open the display
from the context menu in the Alarm Tree.</dd>
<dt>Display</dt>
<dd>The filename of the display associated with the node. If this
property contains the name of a CSS-SDS display file, you can open the display
from the context menu in the Alarm Tree.</dd>
<dt>Help guidance</dt>
<dd>A short description of the node.</dd>
<dt>Help page</dt>
<dd>URL of a web page which provides further information for the node.</dd>
<dt>Name</dt>
<dd>The name of the node. This property cannot be edited.</dd>
<dt>Object class</dt>
<dd>The object class of the entry in the LDAP directory. This property
cannot be edited.</dd>
<dt>Strip chart</dt>
<dd>The filename of a strip chart file associated with the node. If this
property is set, the file can be opened from the context menu.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Note that filenames must be relative to your CSS workspace. For example, the
filename &quot;/SDS/displays/example.css-sds&quot; points to the file
&quot;example.css-sds&quot; in the &quot;displays&quot; folder contained in the
&quot;SDS&quot; project in your workspace.</p>
