<h1>Alarm Tree Developer's Guide</h1>

<p>This document describes the implementation of the alarm tree plug-in. The
alarm tree reads its structure from an LDAP directory and receives updates of
the alarm states via JMS. Alarm states are propagated in the hierarchy, so that
parent nodes display as their severity the highest severity of their
children.</p>
<p>User actions are executed in the tree by selecting the nodes, and then
running the actions from the tree's context menu.</p>
<h2>Initialization</h2>
<p>When the view is created, the plug-in first connects to the JMS servers. When
the connection is established, the structure of the alarm tree is read from the
LDAP directory server. Any JMS messages that are received while reading from the
directory are queued and applied after the reading has completed. The details of
how this works are documented in the source code.</p>
<p>Connecting to JMS and reading from LDAP are done in the background to prevent
the user interface from freezing. The JMS connection job starts (schedules) the
LDAP reader job when the JMS connection is established; and a listener attached
to the LDAP reader job updates the UI and sets the tree as the target for alarm
messages received via JMS when the LDAP reader job is done.</p>
<h2>Propagating severity changes</h2>
<p>Alarm severities are set at the leaf nodes by the LDAP reader and the JMS
listener. The leaf nodes are of type <code>ProcessVariableNode</code> and
represent process variable records. When their alarm state is modified (see
methods <code>setActiveAlarm</code> and <code>setHighestUnacknowledgedAlarm</code>),
they notify their parent node of this change. The parent node then checks if
it needs to update its severity, notifies its parent if necessary, and so
on, until the root of the tree is reached.</p>
<h2>Context menu actions</h2>
<p>Users can execute actions by using the tree's context menu. The actions are
created in <code>AlarmTreeView#makeActions</code> and stored in instance fields
of the <code>AlarmTreeView</code> instance. The context menu is created in the
<code>initializeContextMenu</code> method and filled with items in the
<code>fillContextMenu</code> method. This method adds menu items to the menu
based on the current selection.</p>
<p>For example, the &quot;Run alarm display&quot; action is added only if
exactly one process variable node is selected (i.e. the action will not be
available if multiple nodes are selected or if the selected node is not a 
record but a parent node):</p>
<!-- comment here -->

<pre>	if (selection.size() == 1)
        	&amp;&amp; selection.getFirstElement() instanceof ProcessVariableNode) {
	menu.add(runCssAlarmDisplayAction);
}
</pre>

<p>The <code>AlarmTreeView</code> also listens for selection changes, and
enables/disables the actions based on the selected nodes. For example, the
&quot;Run alarm display&quot; action is disabled if no alarm display is
configured for the selected node.</p>
<p>To add additional items to the context menu, you must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implement the action you want to run as a subclass of
<code>org.eclipse.jface.action.Action</code>.</li>
<li>Add the action to the context menu in the <code>fillContextMenu</code>
method.</li>
<li>Optionally, add code to the <code>selectionChanged</code> method to enable
and disable the action based on the current selection.</li>
</ul>
