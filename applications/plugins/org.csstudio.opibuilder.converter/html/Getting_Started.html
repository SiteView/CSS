    <h2>
     EDM2OPI Converter
    </h2>
    <p>
      EDM2OPI converter can help to convert some basic widgets from EDM edl file to BOY OPI file. Currently, it only supports the 
      conversion of limited EDM widgets: Label, TextUpdate, Rectangle, Line and Group. More widgets will
      be supported in future.
    </p>
    <p>
    To convert edl files to OPI files, all the edl files and the EDM colors.list must be
    accessible in the CSS Workspace, i.e. visible in the CSS Navigator.
    This can be accomplished by copying them into the workspace, or by
    creating a linked folder in the CSS Workspace that points to the directory
    which contains the EDM files.
    To create a linked folder in the Navigator, use use the menu File/New/Other.../General/Folder,
    then the "Advanced" tab to create a folder that links to a directory outside
    of the Workspace.

    </h3>
    <p>
    Before edl files can be converted to OPI, some preferences must be set first as shown in this figure.
   	The preference page can be opened via menu <b>CSS->Preferences...->CSS Applications->Display->EDM2OPI Converter</b>

    <ul>
    <li>
     <b>EDM colors.list File: </b> This is the path of the colors.list file which was copied from EDM.
    </li>
     <li>
     <b>Output OPI Color File: </b> The output path of the OPI color definition file which will be converted
     from colors.list file. After this path has been set, you may need to set the BOY color file to this
     file path too to make colors displayed correctly.
    </li>
     <li>
     <b>Output OPIs Folder: </b> The folder where the converted OPIs will be stored. If this is not specified,
     the output OPIs will be stored in the same folder as the source edl files.
    </li>
     <li>
     <b>Stop parsing at exception: </b> Enable fail-fast mode for stricter tests, which means the parsing will be 
     terminated at any exception.
    </li>
