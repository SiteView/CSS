/**
 * Run context introduced for the case where it cannot be avoided to check whether code should run
 * for tests or for production code.
 * Typically, that's an indicator for bad design as code that is *only* executed for production
 * should rather not be executed at all. But for instance code that submits
 * jvm shutdown hooks via {@link Runtime#addShutdownHook(Thread)} interferes with the starting and
 * stopping procedure for tests of the JUnit framework.
 * In more detail: when JUnit ends a test run, the shutdown thread is invoked by the platform sort
 * of out of sight of the just finished test. The the shutdown hook thread is likely to run when the
 * next test is started by JUnit, which breaks the test encapsulation.
