<h2><a name="overview">Overview</a></h2>
SNL Debugger is a tool to diagnose the running state programs and manage the PRR SNLEXEC.
  It can query the information of a running state program, e.g. list the state sets and variables
  (assigned and non-assigned), get and set the value of a variable, jump to any state of a state
  set, control the state set run mode: normal/suspended/single-step.
  It can also stop a running state program or start a new state program provided that the state
  program is compiled and loaded to the IOC.<br><br>
The following figure is the interface of CSS SNL Debugger. The left part is a tree structure and
 right part shows the details related to the selected node.Some genenral info are shown on the top
 of right side.<br> 
 <ul>
 <li>"Request Status" is the result of the request. It is SUCCESS if the request is successful,
otherwise is FAILED.</li>
 <li> "Driver Name" is RMT or PRR name.</li>
 <li> "Driver Status" is related to the IOC state and Driver Name. It is MASTER or SLAVE when IOC is
  master or slave and Driver Name is RMT. It is active or inactive when IOC is master or slave and
  Driver Name is PRR name.</li>
 <li> "Internal Status" shows the synchronization status of PRR at present.</li>   
 </ul>

<h2><a name="launch">Launch SNL Debugger</a></h2>
SNL Debugger is a part of IOCremoteManagement. IOCremoteManagement can be launched from CSS menu
 CSS->Diagnostic Tools->IOCremoteManagement. A list of IOC IP addresses is shown on the left of
 the interface at the beginning. IP addresses are configurable.  Two IOC addresses are shown in
 the following figure and these two IOCs form a redundant IOC pair.<br>
<img src="snlDebugger_02.PNG" alt="blank" border="0" vspace=15>
<br><br>
After clicking an IP address, two branches are shown: rmtManagement and snlDebugger. snlDebugger
 is for SNL Debugger;  rmtManagement is for RMT management and is not discussed here.<br> 
<img src="snlDebugger_03.PNG" alt="blank" border="0" vspace=15>
<br><br>
After clicking snlDebugger, three sub-branches are shown: snlListSP, snlReport and snlAction.
 Each sub-branch has its own sub-branch or leaf. snlListSP is to list the running state programs.
 snlReport is a command collection to report the status related to SNLEXEC and the running state
 programs. snlAction is a command collection to control the behavior related to SNLEXEC and the
 running state programs. The details for each command will be described in other sections.<br>

<h2><a name="varialbe">Operate a variable</a></h2>
You can get a list of variables for a state program from the tree easily. The statistic info is
 shown on the right side of the interface.
 <ul>
 <li>"numVars" is the variable number including assigned and non-assigned variable.</li>
 <li>"numChans" is the channel number.</li>
 <li>"assignCount" is the assigned variable number.</li>
 <li>"connCount" is the connected channel number.</li>
</ul>
<img src="snlDebugger_05.PNG" alt="blank" border="0" vspace=5>	

<br><br>
There are three properties are shown for a non-assigned variable: assigned, type and value.<br>
<img src="snlDebugger_06.PNG" alt="blank" border="0" vspace=15>	
<br><br>
The value of the variable can be changed from the entry directly if the IOC is master, otherwise
 the warning messages will be given.<br>
<img src="snlDebugger_07.PNG" alt="blank" border="0" vspace=15>	
<br><br>
There is one more property is shown for an assigned variable: dbName.<br>
<img src="snlDebugger_08.PNG" alt="blank" border="0" vspace=15>	
<br><br>
After selecting the record name, a pop-up menu can be arisen when you click the right button of mouse.<br>
<img src="snlDebugger_09.PNG" alt="blank" border="0" vspace=15>	
<br><br>
You can choose the CSS application Data Browser to show the history of the record.<br>

<h2><a name="stateset">Operate a state set</a></h2>
There are eight properties are shown for a state set: threadName, ssRunControl, dbgRunState,
 firstState, currentState, previousState, nextState and Msg. There are combos for the
 properties ssRunControl and currentState.<br>
<img src="snlDebugger_11.PNG" alt="blank" border="0" vspace=15>	
<br><br>
You can jump to any state of the state set through selection from currentState's combo 
 provided that the IOC is master and dbgRunState is RUNNING.<br>
<img src="snlDebugger_12.PNG" alt="blank" border="0" vspace=15>	
<br><br>
You can control the control the state set run mode through selection from ssRunControl's combo
 provided that the IOC is master. dbgRunState should be STOPPED for single-step mode.<br>

<h2><a name="snlReport">Report the status of SNLEXEC and running state programs</a></h2>
There are four commands to report the status related to SNLEXEC and the running state programs:
 snlTransStatReport, snlShowAllSP, snlShowSync, snlShowTuningTime.<br><br>
snlTransStatReport is to report the data transfer statistic form master IOC to slave IOC.<br>
 "FullUpdateCount" is the update number.<br> 
 "LastFullCycleTime" is the total transfer time for the last update.<br> 
 "LastFullSendCount" is the sent package count for the last update.<br>
 "LastFullSendBytes" is the total bytes for the last update.<br>  
 The left properties are easy to understand.<br> 
<img src="snlDebugger_14.PNG" alt="blank" border="0" vspace=15>	
<br><br>
snlShowAllSP is to show the thread id, thread name and state set name for all running state programs. 
<img src="snlDebugger_15.PNG" alt="blank" border="0" vspace=15>	
<br><br>
snlShowSync is to show the synchronization status. The synchronization is ON if snlsyncHold is FALSE,
 otherwise is OFF.<br>
<img src="snlDebugger_16.PNG" alt="blank" border="0" vspace=15>	
<br><br>
snlShowTuningTime is to show some tuning time settings.
 "snlUpdatePeriod" is the update period, and it is set to 1.0 second at present.
 The other time settings can be ignored by SNL Debugger users.<br>

<h2><a name="snlAction">Control the behavior of SNLEXEC and running state programs</a></h2>
There are four commands to report the status related to SNLEXEC and the running state programs:
 snlStopSync, snlStartSync, seqStop, seq, snlRebuildSprogEntry.
<br><br>
snlStopSync is to stop the synchronization.<br>
<img src="snlDebugger_18.PNG" alt="blank" border="0" vspace=15>	
<br><br>
snlStartSync is to start the synchronization.<br>
<img src="snlDebugger_19.PNG" alt="blank" border="0" vspace=15>	
<br><br>
seqStop is to stop a running state program. The precondition is that the synchronization is stopped.
 You should click the button "call it" after selecting the thread id from the related combo.<br>
<img src="snlDebugger_20.PNG" alt="blank" border="0" vspace=15>	
<br><br>
You can use the command snlShowAllSP to check the result. The thread id is related to state program
 "sncGliu", and you can find that this state program is disappeared.<br>
<img src="snlDebugger_21.PNG" alt="blank" border="0" vspace=15>	
<br><br>
seq is to start a new state program. The preconditions are that the state program is compiled and 
 loaded to the IOC, and the synchronization is stopped. You should click the button "call it" after
 inputting the spName, macroStr and stackSize. macroStr and stackSize are optional.<br>
<img src="snlDebugger_22.PNG" alt="blank" border="0" vspace=15>	
<br><br>
You can use the command snlShowAllSP to check the result similarly. The state program "sncGliu" is
 shown again.<br>
<img src="snlDebugger_23.PNG" alt="blank" border="0" vspace=15>	
<br><br>
snlRebuildSprogEntry is to rebuild the state program entry table. The precondition is that the
 synchronization is stopped. Normally you need not use it.<br>
