API for accessing control system variables (Process Variables, PVs).

See PVFactory to get started.
<p>

The actual implementation has to be in another
plugin that implements the IPVFactory interface.

<p>
There can be more than one implementation, each providing a
prefix so that PVs named
<pre>
 prefix://name
</pre>
are then created by the PV factory implementation that registred
with the corresponding prefix.

<p>
Basic idea for the PV 'connect' behavior:
<ol>
<li>First, it obviously tries to connect to a channel.
<li>When that suceeds, and we thus know the native type etc. of the channel,
    it requests meta information (units, precision, ...).
<li>When receiving that, it subscribes to updates of timestamp/value/status
<li>When receiving the first subscription update, we declare the PV
    fully 'connected'.
</ol>
Consequently, users of this API get the full value and meta information
without having to worry about details.
