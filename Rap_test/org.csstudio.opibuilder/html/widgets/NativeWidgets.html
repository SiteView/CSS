    <h2>
      Native Widgets
    </h2>
    
    <p>Native widgets are those widgets provided by the platform on which the OPI is running.
    They are rendered by the OS or RAP platform (WebOPI) instead of drawing it on canvas as other
    widgets in BOY.
    Usually, they not only have better looking, but also have significantly better performance in WebOPI, 
    so it is strongly recommended to use native widgets as much as possible for OPI to be 
    ran in WebOPI. 
    In OPI editing mode, the widget is disabled so user can click on it to select it, but it is 
    usually in gray color even you haved changed the fore/background color, so you need 
    to run the OPI to see it's real looking in run mode. </p>
