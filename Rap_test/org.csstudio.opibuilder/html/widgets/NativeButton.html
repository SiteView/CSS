    <h2>
      Native Button
    </h2>
    
    <p>Native button widget is using the button widget provided by the operating system,
     so it may have better but different looking and better performance. 
     It has exact same functions as <a href="ActionButton.html">Action Button</a>, 
    so please see <a href="ActionButton.html">Action Button</a> for its properties and behaviors.
    </p>
    <p><b>Tip:</b> Native widgets not only have better looking, but also have significantly better performance in WebOPI, 
    so it is strongly recommended to use native widgets as much as possible for OPI to be ran in WebOPI.</p>
