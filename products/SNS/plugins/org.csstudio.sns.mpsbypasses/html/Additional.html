The Logbook option is a pulldown menu containing all the possible logbook selections.  The title and text entries
are written for the user, but both areas are editable.  So information can be added or removed from these text entry
areas.  To send the Elog, the user must enter their UCAMS UID and password.  Once all the data is acceptable, the
user can press the OK button to send it to the Elog or the Cancel button to cancel the Elog entry process.
<h2>Bypass Request Web System</h2>
There are 4 selections under the Bypass Request Web Options.  To see and select options, press the <u>Press for Web
