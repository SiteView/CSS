<h1>MPS Bypass Display and RDB Information Exchange</h1>
The CSS MPS Bypass Table enables users to input different options for 3 variables used in RDB queries.
<br>
<h2>SNS Machine Modes </h2>
The MPS Bypass gui enables the user to select the Machine Mode that the model uses to get the necessary RDB information 
for MPS Bypasses in that Machine Mode.  The options for the Machine Mode are
<ol><li><b>MEBT_BS</b> - Medium Energy Beam Transport Beam Stop</li><br>
<li><b>CCL_BS</b> - Normal Conducting Linac Beam Stop</li><br>
<li><b>LDmp</b> - Linac Dump</li><br>
<li><b>IDmp</b> - Ring Injection Dump</li><br>
<li><b>Ring</b> - Ring</li><br>
<li><b>EDmp</b> - Ring Extraction Dump</li><br>
<li><b>Tgt</b> - Target Systems</li><br>
<li><b>Site</b> - All the Machine Modes listed above.</li><br>
</ol><br>
<h2>SNS MPS Bypass States </h2>
The MPS has defined 6 MPS Bypass States.  They are listed and explained below.
<ol><li><b>Error</b></li>
<p>This should not happen, it is the result of a configuration error. Cannot happen, 
it is not allowable in hardware. This causes the chassis to trip on a config error.</p>
<li><b>Bypassed</b></li>
<p>The jumper allows the bypass to be enabled, and Operators masked this MPS input. The MPS input is bypassed, 
it will NOT trip the MPS. This state is also known as Active Bypass because the bypass is active, meaning that the MPS input 
is actually no longer active.</p>
<li><b>Bypassable</b></li>
<p>The jumper would allow the bypass to be enabled, but for now the MPS input has not been masked by Operators. 
The MPS input is operational, it will trip the MPS. This state is also known as Active Bypass Enable because an active bypass 
could be enabled, but isn't at this time.</p>
<li><b>NotBypassable</b></li>
<p>The bypass cannot be enabled (no jumper), and Operators have not masked it. The MPS input is operational, 
it will trip the MPS.</p>
<li><b>Disconnected</b></li>
<p>If either the _sw_jump_status or the _swmask pvs are Disconnected the result will be Disconnected.</p>
<li><b>All</b></li>
<p>All MPS Bypass States listed above</p>
</ol><br>
<h2>SNS Bypass Request Status</h2><ol>
<li><b>Requested</b> - A Bypass Request has been entered.</li><br>
<li><b>Not Requested</b> - A Bypass Request has NOT been entered.</li><br>
<li><b>All</b> - Both the Requested and Not Requested bypass statuses will be displayed</p></ol><br>
<h2>SNS MPS Bypass Counts</h2>
The following bypass counts are displayed based on the inputs for Machine Mode.
<ol><li>Total Number of <b>Bypasses</b>
<p>All the MPS Bypasses in the selected Machine Mode.</p><br>
<li>Total Number of <b>Bypassable</b> Bypasses</li>
<p>All the MPS Bypasses in the selected Machine Mode that are Bypassable </p><br>
<li>Total Number of <b>Bypassed</b> Bypasses</li>
<p>All the MPS Bypasses in the selected Machine Mode that are Bypassed.</p><br>
<li>Total Number of <b>Disconnected</b> Bypasses</li>
<p>All the MPS Bypasses in the selected Machine Mode that are Disconnected.</p><br>
<li>Total Number of <b>NotBypassable</b> Bypasses</li>
<p>All the MPS Bypasses in the selected Machine Mode that are NotBypassable.</p><br>
<li>Total Number of Bypasses in <b>Error</b></li>
<p>All the MPS Bypasses in the selected Machine Mode that are in Error.  This number should
always be 0.</p>
