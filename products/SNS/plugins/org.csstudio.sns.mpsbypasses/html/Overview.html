<h1>Purpose</h1>
<p>This tool implements a system for monitoring the status of the MPS 
Bypass PVs and bypass requests.</p>

<p>The relational database (RDB) provides a list of MPS Bypasses for each machine mode.
To determine the <u>current</u> state of each bypass, the tool connects to two 
Process Variables (PVs) for each bypass, a <i><b>mask</b></i> and <i><b>switch</b></i> PV
for each bypass.</p>

<h2>Bypass Status Table </h2>

<p>The bypass name read from the RDB may for example be <b>Ring_Vac:SGV_AB:FPL_Ring</b>.
It indicates a sector gate valve bypass <b>Ring_Vac:SGV_AB</b> in the
Fast-Protect Latch (FPL) chain of the Ring.
</p>

<p>The current status of this bypass is provided by the two PVs
<b>Ring_Vac:SGV_AB:FPL_Ring_swmask</b> and <b>Ring_Vac:SGV_AB:FPL_Ring_sw_jump_status</b>,
i.e. by adding <b>_swmask</b> respectively <b>_sw_jump_status</b> to the bypass name.
</p>

<p>In short, the possible values from these two PVs are decoded as follows:
</p>

<table border="1">
<tr>
  <td></td>
  <td>sw_jump_status active=0</td>
  <td>sw_jump_status active=1</td>
  <td>sw_jump_status disconnected</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>mask=0</td>
  <td>Non-bypassable</td>
  <td>Bypassable</td>
  <td>Disconnected</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>mask=1</td>
  <td>Error</td>
  <td>Bypassed</td>
  <td>Disconnected</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>mask disconnected</td>  <td>Disconnected</td>  <td>Disconnected</td>  <td>Disconnected</td>
</tr>
</table> 

<p>The PV names associated with a bypass are also available from the context menu
of a bypass: When opening the context menu of a bypass, you can send the PV names
for the "..._swmask" and "..._sw_jump_status" to for example the Data Browser
to inspect how they change over time:

<h2>Detailed Bypass Status Explanation </h2>

<ol>
<li><i>sw_jump_status</i> = 0, <i>swmask</i> = 0: <b>Non-bypassable</b> <br/>
The bypass cannot be enabled (no jumper), and Operators have not masked it (mask=0).
The MPS input is operational, it will trip the MPS.
</li>

<li><i>sw_jump_status</i> = 1, <i>swmask</i> = 0: <b>Bypassable</b> <br/> 
The jumper would allow the bypass to be enabled, but for now the MPS input 
has not been masked by Operators (mask=0).
The MPS input is operational, it will trip the MPS.
This state is also known as <b>Active Bypass Enable</b>
because an active bypass could be enabled, but isn't at this time.
</li>

<li><i>sw_jump_status</i> = 1, <i>swmask</i> = 1: <b>Bypassed</b> <br/> 
The jumper allows the bypass to be enabled, and Operators masked this MPS 
input (mask=1).  The MPS input is bypassed, it will NOT trip the MPS.
This state is also known as <b>Active Bypass</b> because the bypass is active, 
meaning that the MPS input is actually no longer active.
</li>

<li><i>sw_jump_status</i> = 0, <i>swmask</i> = 1: <b>Error</b> <br/>
This should not happen, it is the result of a configuration error.
Cannot happen, it is not allowed by hardware.  This causes the chassis to trip on a configuration error.
</li>

<li>Any PV disconnected: <b>Disconnected</b> <br/>
If either the sw_jump_status or the swmask PVs are disconnected the overall result will be Disconnected.
This indicates that either a portion of the MPS is currently offline,
a network communication error, or the MPS configuration in the RDB lists
bypasses that don't really exist.
</li>

</ol>

<h2>Display Colors</h2>

<p>The following color scheme is used for displaying MPS 
Bypass information, based on MPS bypass pv status and MPS bypass request status.
